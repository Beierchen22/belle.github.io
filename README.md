### Basic personal information
I am Chen Beier, a sophomore student from sichuan university.

School of public administration, information resource management, is currently studying the course of Internet analysis and governance.
### About my major
Information resource management.  
When I was a freshman, I applied for library information and archives management. After two years of study, I had a clearer understanding of the division of major, so I chose the major of information resource management.  
In my opinion, in today's society with the rapid development of information, it is very necessary to acquire, analyze and utilize information, which is not only related to individuals, but also related to the development of the society and the country.
I hope my study can go to a higher platform in the future and contribute to the country in the information industry.
### Personal interests and specialties
Personally, I am actually good at the career related to the news media that I love. In my life, I also like to record the text, pictures and video blog.  
After majoring in information resource management, I also want to combine this major with my own interests. Sometimes I think news media and information resource management are also related.
